# Email-spam-classifier-project
ðŸ“§ Email Spam Classifier  This project is a machine learning-based web application that automatically classifies emails as Spam or Not Spam (Ham). With the growing volume of digital communication, spam emails have become a major challenge, often carrying phishing links, advertisements, or malicious attachments.

The solution is developed in Python, using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and NLTK for natural language processing (NLP) and model training. The dataset consists of labeled emails, where each message is categorized as spam or ham. Preprocessing steps include tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization, and TF-IDF vectorization to transform raw email text into numerical features suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Several classification models are tested, including Multinomial NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Among these, Multinomial NaÃ¯ve Bayes is highly effective due to its efficiency in text classification tasks. The model is trained and evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring a balanced performance between detecting spam and avoiding false positives.

The trained model is then integrated into a Streamlit-based web application. Users can input an email message into the app, and the model instantly predicts whether the email is spam or not. The interface is designed to be simple and interactive, allowing easy access for both technical and non-technical users. Additionally, the project supports model persistence with Joblib, ensuring the trained model can be reused without retraining.

To make the project more robust, it also includes error handling and preprocessing pipelines to manage different types of input data. Future improvements may include experimenting with deep learning models (RNNs, LSTMs, or Transformers) for enhanced accuracy, integrating a real-time email API for automatic classification, and deploying the application on Heroku, AWS, or Render for broader accessibility.

Overall, this project highlights the power of machine learning and NLP in cybersecurity and communication filtering. It provides a strong foundation for building scalable email filtering systems and demonstrates how AI can protect users from malicious or unwanted content.
